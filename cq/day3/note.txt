OPERATORS:
    .   //access by object
    ->  //access by address
    Precedence:
    1.                      ()  
                            []
                            .
                            ->
  -----------------------------
    2.                    unary opeerators.
                            +  //possitive
                            -  //negate
                            ++
                            --
                            ~  //1's comple
                            !
                            &
                            *  //de refference operator//indirection operator
                            sizeof()/???
                            typecast



sizeof():
    returns size of parameter in bytes
    always returns unsigned integral(int,long int, ..... ) type of value(sizes can never be in -ve) 
    also called size_t  return type of sizeof() = size_t = unsigned long int

    inside sizeof no assignment / evaluation is possible
        eg: sizeof(X++);//it will not increment and x remains same


, :
        evaluates from right



> or <
    when comparing signed and unsigned value,signed is promoted to unsigned and compared bit by bit
    


 eg:
    #include<std>
    int main()
    {
        unsigned int x=-1;
        y=~0;
        if(y == x)
            printf(same);
        else
            pf(not same);    
    }   
-------------------------------
eg:
    float x = 0.5;
    if(x == 0.5)
        printf("IF");
    else if(x == o.5f)
        pf("else if")   //    perfect fractions will be saved in same pattern in both float and double
    else
        pf("else");

INCREMENT and DECREMENT OPERATORS:

    pre increment
        first increment value then use
    post increment
        first use then increment 
    pre decrement
        first decrement value then use
    post decrement
        first use then decrement

    in stand alone/independent expression will be equal to pre increment 
    ->in any dependent expression all the pre increment/decrement operations will be performed before assignments
        all post inc/dec will be performed after the assignment
