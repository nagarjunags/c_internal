SIEVES ALGORITHM:(for finding primes)
    if given number n is not devisible by any prime facor then given n is prime number


eg:github.com/nagarjunags/c_internal/cc/day4/sieves_prime.c
    github.com/nagarjunags/c_internal/cc/day4/isprime.c
    n=30
    1 2 3 //4 5 //6 7 //8 //9 //10 11 //12 13 //14 //15 //16 17 //18 19 //20 //21 //22 23 //24 //25 //26 //27 //28 29 //30

    keep 2 and remove multiple of 2
    keep 3 and remove multiple of 3
    4 gets skipped
    keep 5 and remove multiples of 5


    remaining are the primes
